Hello, this page is the handbook for the Intentional Society Handbook.

In the table of contents \(rendered on the left, or via slide-out menu on mobile/narrow screens\) you'll see pages documenting our official positions, agreements, and decisions as a whole community. For things that are not written here, we _may_ have conscious-but-unwritten norms or unconscious norms - please feel free to ask!

This is a living document, subject to continuous revision through [decision-making](decision-making.md) processes.

The handbook's canonical location is a Git repository [here](https://github.com/james-baker/is-handbook).
